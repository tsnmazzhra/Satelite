            <h4>We launch things into space by putting them on rockets with enough fuel — called propellant — to boost
                them
                above most of Earth's atmosphere. Once a rocket reaches the right distance from Earth, it releases the
                satellite
                or spacecraft.</h4>

            <h4>We launch satellites and spacecraft into space by putting them on rockets carrying tons of propellants.
                The
                propellants give the rocket enough energy to boost away from Earth's surface. Because of the pull of
                Earth's
                gravity, largest, heaviest spacecraft need the biggest rockets and the most propellent.</h4>

            <h4>More than 300 years ago, a scientist named Isaac Newton laid out three basic laws that describe the way
                things move. One of the laws says that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This
                is the most important idea behind how rockets work.</h4>

            <img src="action_reaction.en.gif">

            <h4>If you see pictures or videos of a launch, you'll see exhaust streaming out the bottom of the rocket.
                Exhaust is the flames, hot gases and smoke that come from burning the rocket's propellants.

                The exhaust pushes out of a rocket's engine down toward the ground. Thats the <strong>action
                    force</strong>. In response, the rocket begins moving in the opposite direction, lifting off the
                ground. Thats the <strong>reaction force.</strong>
            </h4>

            <h4>Let's say you want to launch a satellite that orbits Earth. The rocket will launch, and when it gets to
                a specific distance from Earth, it will release the satellite.</h4>

            <img src="spacecraft_nudge.en.gif">
            <br>
            <h4>The satellite stays in orbit because it still has momentum—energy it picked up from the rocket—pulling
                it in one direction. Earth's gravity pulls it in another direction. This balance between gravity and
                momentum keeps the satellite orbiting around Earth.</h4>

            <img src="spacecraft_gravity.en.gif">
            <br>
            <h4>Satellites that orbit close to Earth feel a stronger tug of Earth's gravity. To stay in orbit, they must
                travel faster than a satellite orbiting farther away.
                The International Space Station orbits about 250 miles above the Earth and travels at a speed of about
                17,150 miles per hour. Compare that to the Tracking and Data Relay Satellites, which help us get
                information to and from other NASA missions. These satellites orbit at a height of more than 22,000
                miles and travel much slower—about 6,700 miles per hour—to maintain their high orbit.</h4>

            <h4>If you're trying to get to another planet, you'll need a fast-moving rocket to overcome Earth's gravity.
                To do that, you'd have to speed up to around 25,000 mph. But you'll also need to figure out the best
                time to leave Earth to get to that planet.</h4>
            <h4>
                For example, Mars and Earth reach their closest distance to each other about every two years. This is
                the best time to go to Mars, since it requires the least amount of propellant and time to get there. But
                you'll still need to launch your rocket at the right time to make sure the spacecraft and Mars arrive at
                the same place at the same time.
